        "Out here in the fields\nI fight for my meals\nI get my back into my living\nI don't need to fight\nTo prove I'm right\nI don't need to be forgiven\n\nDon't cry\nDon't raise your eye\nIt's only teenage wasteland\n\nSally, take my hand\nTravel south cross land\nPut out the fire\nAnd don't look past my shoulder\nThe exodus is here\nThe happy ones are near\nLet's get together\nBefore we get much older\n\nTeenage wasteland\nIt's only teenage wasteland\nTeenage wasteland\nOh, yeah\nTeenage wasteland\nThey're all wasted!",

        "1. Ah! I love the colorful clothes she wears,\nand the way the sunlight plays upon her hair\nAhhhhhh! I hear the sound of a gentle word,\non the wind that lifts her perfume through the air.\n\nI'm pickin' up good vibrations, she's givin' me the excitations.\nI'm pickin' up good vibrations, she's givin' me the excitations.\n\nGood, good, good, good vibrations, she's givin' me the excitation.\nGood, good, good, good vibrations, she's givin' me the excitations.\n\n2. Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now,\nsoftly smile, I know she must be kind.\nWhen I look in her eyes,\nshe goes with me to a blossom world.\n\nREFRAIN\n\nMy, my, my, what e(lation),\nI don`t know where, but she sends me there.\nMy, my, my, what a sen(sation),\nMy, my, my, what elation.\n\n(Gotta keep those love good\nVibrations are happening with her)  x3\n\nAhhhhhh!\n\nREFRAIN\n",
